# Dark Mode Background Color Fix

This fix addresses the issue where background colors were not being properly changed to dark colors when a dark mode theme was requested.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Background Color Analysis**: The content script now properly analyzes and categorizes background colors on the page.

2. **Semantic Color Information**: Colors are now categorized by their role (background, text, border, etc.), ensuring dark mode applies correctly.

3. **Dark Mode Detection**: The system can now reliably detect when a dark theme is requested.

4. **Background Color Enforcement**: When a dark theme is applied, the script ensures that all background colors are properly dark, especially for the HTML and BODY elements.

5. **Color Processing**: The background script now includes logic to check if mapped colors are appropriately dark.

## How to Apply This Fix

### Option 1: Run the Build Script

We've provided a build script that handles everything automatically:

```
build.bat
```

This script will:
1. Copy the fixed content script to replace the original
2. Append the needed color utility functions to the background script
3. Run the build process
4. Restore the original files after building

### Option 2: Manual Fix

If you prefer to make the changes manually:

1. Replace `content.ts` with `content-dark-fix.ts`:
   ```
   copy /Y .\src\content-dark-fix.ts .\src\content.ts
   ```

2. Add the color utility functions from `background-fix.ts` to the bottom of your `background.ts` file.

3. Build the extension:
   ```
   pnpm build
   ```

## Testing

After applying the fix, test the dark mode by:

1. Opening a website with a light background
2. Clicking the Themer extension icon
3. Selecting "Dark" as the theme
4. Clicking "Apply"

The background should now properly change to a dark color.

## Notes

- This fix focuses specifically on the background color issue while maintaining compatibility with the rest of the codebase.
- The content script has been completely rewritten to better handle semantic color analysis.
- The background script now includes post-processing to ensure dark themes have appropriately dark background colors.
